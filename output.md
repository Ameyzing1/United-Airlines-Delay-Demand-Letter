RE: Delayed Flight {{AirlineFlightNumber}}  

To whom it may concern,  

My name is  {{FirstName}} {{LastName}} and I was a passenger on an {{{AirlineName}} flight, Flight # {{{AirlineFlightNumber}}. This was a {{DomesticOrInternational}} flight. The flight was scheduled to depart from {{FlightDepartureCity}} at {{FlightDepartureTime}} and arrive at {{FlightArrivalCity}} at {{FlightArrival Time}} on {{Flight Date}}. However the flight was delayed by {{HoursDelayed}} and did not arrive until {{ActualArrivalTime}}.


In accordance with the Rules of the American Airlines Contract of Carriage, I herewith assert the following claims:

No services were rendered or offered during the delay. I therefore incurred the following expenses:  
-Meals and refreshments:  {{MealAndRefreshmentExpensesAmount}} dollars  
-Communications {{telephone/email/fax}}: {{CommunicationsExpensesAmount}} dollars  
-Hotel expenses:  {{HotelExpensesAmount}} dollars  
-Transfer expenses between airport and hotel:  {{TransferExpensesAmount}} dollars  
-Other expenses:  {{OtherExpensesAmount}} dollars  
-Other expenses:  {{OtherExpensesAmount}} dollars  

In addition to the economic loses that I incurred while traveling on {{AirlineName}} Flight # {{AirlineFlightNumber}}, I also experienced inappropriate behavior from one of your {{AirlineName}} employees.   {{DescribeInappropirateBehavior}} 

Pursuant to Rule 24 and Rule 27  in {{AirlineName}} Contract of Carriage and in conjunction with the U.S Department of Transportation, I am entitled to compensation for my expenses and losses. In this context, I refer to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s guidelines on consumer protections and passed by the highest court of justice, on which grounds I request you to pay the compensation due to me, the amount of which is calculated in accordance with the flight distance and therefore totals {{TotalExpensesOwed}} dollars. Please remit your payment via check to the following:

Your Name: {{FirstName}} {{LastName}}  
Street Address:  {{StreetAddress}}  
City: {{City}}  
Zip: {{Zip}}	  
State: {{State}}  	

Should I receive no reply within the next 4 weeks, or if your response is unsatisfactory, I shall immediately contact the Department of Transportation with a request to assert my claims. 

Kind regards,

Your Name: {{FirstName}} {{LastName}}
